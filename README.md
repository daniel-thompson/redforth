redforth - A simple, portable and  ROMable Forth implementation
===============================================================

redforth is currently incomplete and is missing several critical pieces
and is being aggressively refactored It is derived from
https://github.com/daniel-thompson/jonesforth-c so, if you are interest
in a simple, well documented Forth implemented in C then, for now, you
are better off looking at jonesforth-c!
